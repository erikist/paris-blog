lived. And to Caitlin, who is never afraid to embark on an adventure._

Forward

At heart, I am a simple Southerner. I enjoy good food, programming and imbibing a bit more than is strictly necessary. There
are a few folks who might remark that I am an intellectual because I make it a goal to read a book everyday. I would contend
that because I mostly read trashy self published sci-fi that sometimes borders on smut, that this description is a bit of a stretch. 
Others might remark that I am a _bourgeoisie_ due to my love of fine dining. Again, I would counter that you probably need
look less homeless to be considered _bourgeoisie_. My stepfather, Jim, inspired me to write some of a book, which this collection
of experiences might lead to. I am calling it _An Southerner's guide to Paris_.

I have been to mainland Europe once before, on a trip to Denmark with my girlfriend Caitlin. In the first few months we met,
we visited my parents in Charleston. We had the bright idea, that to really get to know one another, we should go on a bit
of an adventure and decided to embark on new years eve to Copenhagen. The trip was spontaneous and driven by an amusing statment
from my mother. She mentioned that we were "too poor to go to Saint-Martin" and we largely agreed. So we looked up flights 
to random places and noticed most were being routed through Denmark, and the prices for Denmark were decidedly cheap in the
middle of winter. So, we booked a flight and an Airbnb and set off one what would become the trip of a lifetime. 

It was Caitlin's birthday during the trip and we began to joke that for her birthday we travel to an exotic land, while for
mine we go to a restaurant in our hometown of Atlanta. I liked the romantic nature of this, and decided to keep the tradition 
alive. This year, we decided to go to Paris.

The Plan
---------------
I would like to tell you that we have some sort of great plan as we arrive in Paris, but I am afraid that would be a lie. 
Our plan consisted of a vague notion of little more than "thoughtful days and decadent nights" achieved through the use
of museum pass that would let us in to the museums we could name off the top of our head and randomly pointing our finger 
at the Michelin guide for Paris. I believe that some of the best adventures are left mostly to chance. How could we go 
wrong? Eating at a Michelin starred restaurant every night and visiting the Louvre, the Musee d'Orsay, the Pompidou... 
Based on numbers alone, we could spend the better part of a year doing this and we wouldn't run out of material. I dont't
speak French, so whats the point of reading the reviews?

The biggest cause of concern I have is that I am being sent various dress codes with each new reservation. I am not really
sure what "business-chic" means, especially as a programmer whose business attire is usually looking good so long as I have
a shirt without holes and am wearing pants. I tried on a few suits from the closet to discover that apparently they had
specifically shrunk in the waist on all of them. So, I need to buy new suits, and this trip is racking up a few more extraneous
costs.

On Arrival
---------------
Arriving in Paris, like any long trip east, left us in a sort of mental fugue. I was more tired than Caitlin, unable to 
contain my excitement on the plane. I also found the first four episodes of the _Yellowstone_ spin-off _1923_ which was
more exciting than I should admit. Harrison Ford is a hell of an actor, what more can I say? 

Upon exiting the taxi, and seeing the streets of Paris for the first time, I was struck by darkness of the streets and the
overwhelming smell. It was a cross between a muskiness, and, well, urine. I wouldn't call myself disillusioned by it, as 
I try to not speculate on what something will be too much before I experience it. I was, however, surprised. Are people 
just urinating in the streets? As we entered our apartment, Caitlin did some cursory Googling of the issue and found out about
"free peeing" in Paris. Apparently, the city has a problem with public urination and despite outlawing it, has not been able 
tamp down on the _bon vivant_ spirit of urinating whenever the urge hits you. I kid you not, there are public service campaigns
with jaunty lyrics:

> Who are these men who, standing before a dry wall, unzip their pants? They know it won’t be washed tonight. Because the 
> street cleaners are not ‘les dames pipi’... Give a kiss hello without asking yourself, ‘Is it you or the street that smells like that’

What a time to be alive, but alas, I digress.

Other folks might make more of their first day, on their first time, in a strange new foreign land. I slept. We found our 
apartment around noon and I tucked in until 5pm. Caitlin, being the more adventurous of the two of us, went out and found 
a grocery store and explored Parisian streets while I explored the duvet and the pillows.

I woke up after a several hour nap and was told our first stop on our haphazard tour of the Paris Michelin guide was a
restaurant called [the Alliance](https://www.restaurant-alliance.fr/en/).
